# NPI Calculator Project

This project is a Reverse Polish Notation (NPI) calculator implemented in TypeScript. Reverse Polish Notation is a mathematical notation in which every operator follows all of its operands. It does not need any parentheses as long as the operators have a fixed number of operands. For example, the expression `3 + 4` in standard notation would be written as `3 4 +` in NPI.
